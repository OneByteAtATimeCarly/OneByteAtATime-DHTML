           In a twist of <U>time</U>, <U>space</U> and <U>dimension</U> the realms collided. The 
           land of <B>shadows</B> and the land of <B>light</B>. The people of the <STRONG>sky</STRONG> 
           entwined with those of <STRONG>earth</STRONG>. <I>Midna</I>, princess from the kingdom
           of <U>Twilight</U> joined forces with <I>Zelda</I>, princess of <U>Skyloft</U> and <U>Hyrule</U>.
           Unfortunately, this unforseen cataclysm provided the means for both
           Zant, the Shadow King, and Demise, the Demon King to resurrect 
           themselves in an unholy alliance of hatred and vengeance.           

           In order to defeat this impossible menage of violence, villainy and
           viciousness, <B>Link</B>, <B>Zelda</B>, <B>Midna</B> and <B>Fi</B> had to combine their 
           strengths and subdue their weaknesses, forming a most unusual
           collection of comradery - a bedazzling band of brothers!

           They knew that once again they must gather to themselves three
           sacred flames. Once again the <B>Master Sword</B> <I>Fi</I> must be imbued with
           these holy ignitions. Only then would they have the power required 
           to seek the Tri-force amidst the combined onslaught of <I>Zant</I> and 
           <I>Demise</I>'s forces. It was only then that they could free the realms
           of <I>Girahim's</I> treachery and tyranny.
